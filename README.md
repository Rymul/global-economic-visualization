Global Economic Data Visualization
---
---

This project is an interactive view of key economic data across the globe.
Containing GDP, GDP per capita, unemployment, consumer price index, and much more.
This project contains a 3D rendering of the globe, where users can navigate around our planet
and investigate the economic conditions of different countries.
You can filter the visualization either by year or economic datum (will default to GDP).
If you select a given country it will provide a table at the bottom of the globe with the
associated data.



In Our Home By the Numbers, users will be able to
---
---

* Navigate the globe
* Select individual countries to see their economic data
* Filter the data displayed by either year or economic datum

Implementation Timeline
---

* Friday & Weekend: Setup project, including getting webpack set up, get basic display to show
    on screen, do research into D3 and Chart.js, make sure fetching and using data from 
    Econ DB API is working.

* Monday: Organize data to be able to display on globe and build globe. Ensure it is rendering
    on screen.

* Tuesday: Build functionality of drop down, nav bar, and description sections. Start to build
    data table under globe.

* Wednesday: If not complete finish constructing data table. Focus on styling.

* Thursday: Add finishing touches to make project functional and visually pleasing. If time
    permits rewrite this as a production README.
