Global Economic Data Visualization
---
---

This project is an interactive examination of global population.
This project contains a 3D rendering of the globe, where users can navigate around our planet
and investigate the population trends of different countries.
By selecting a country, a graph will appear showing the population over the time frame available.



In Our Home By the Numbers, users will be able to:
---
---

* Find instructions on how to navigate the globe
* Navigate the globe by allowing it to rotate or by dragging the globe themselves
* Select individual countries to see their population trends

* The nav bar contains links to my Github repo, my LinkedIn, and my personal website.
* The instructions on how to use the visualization will appear when the project is launched.
* The center will contain an globe users can interact will to explore the data of our home.
* When selecting a country a table will appear showing the population data for that country.


Technologies, Libraries, API's:
---
---

* D3.js
* Charts.js
* Econ DB API
* JSDelivr API
* Google fonts API



Implementation Timeline:
---
---

* Friday & Weekend: Setup project, including getting webpack set up, get basic display to show
    on screen, do research into D3 and Chart.js, make sure fetching and using data from 
    Econ DB API is working.

* Monday: Organize data to be able to display on globe and build globe. Ensure it is rendering
    on screen.

* Tuesday: Build functionality of drop down, nav bar, and description sections. Start to build
    data table under globe.

* Wednesday: If not complete finish constructing data table. Focus on styling.

* Thursday: Add finishing touches to make project functional and visually pleasing. If time
    permits rewrite this as a production README.


Bonus Features:
---
---

* Button to toggle between light and dark mode
* Calming music with mute button
* A bar chart superimposed on the globe showing population data.
* An optional comparison chart to compare populations of different countries


To Do:
---
---

* Create a discrete modal to show when a country does not have data.
* Fix the dragging function to be more smooth.
* Find a more comprehensive data source.
